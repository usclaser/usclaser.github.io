## Research

Increasingly capable algorithms are required to take dynamic mobile robots out of the lab and into the field. Operating under challenging conditions with real-world constraints, these robots face situations that are **uncertain**, **unknown**, or **unstructured** with limitations in perception, real-time demands on compute, and often with complex or stochastic dynamics.

LASER develops methods for adaptive decision-making under uncertainty for these systems, drawing from *control theory*, *reinforcement learning*, and *stochastic modeling*, with an emphasis on a "theory to practice‚Äù philosophy including field hardware validation: our work has flown on the International Space Station and, in the coming months, to the Moon. Our overarching goal is to make autonomous robotic operations safer and more efficient when human-in-the-loop operation becomes infeasible, risky, or wasteful.
