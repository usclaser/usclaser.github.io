I like to get robots into the field to uncover new algorithmic insights and verify performance in complex situations that often break initial algorithmic assumptions. My algorithms have flown on-orbit multiple times and I am responsible for multiple autonomy "firsts" that will fly to the moon on NASA's CADRE lunar rovers in the near future on the Intuitive Machines-3 lander[^1]. My work includes the first autonomous on-orbit rendezvous with an uncharacterized tumbling target; the (soon-to-be!) first model predictive controller to run on another celestial body; and the (soon-to-be!) first distributed algorithm in a multi-agent space exploration mission. I was a contributing developer to NASA's Astrobee platform[^2], and was the last researcher to work with MIT's [SPHERES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPHERES) platform. My favorite applications are in the space domain, including planetary surface robotics, microgravity robotics, and other canonical problem areas like powered descent guidance. I also work on broadly applicable platforms, including medical robotic devices, maritime robotics, and ground vehicle robotics.

### Education

* Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics (Autonomous Systems), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2022
* S.M. in Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2019
* B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Columbia University, 2017

I received a Ph.D. in aeronautics and astronautics (autonomous systems) from MIT in 2022 under a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship. Before that, I received my B.S. in mechanical engineering (minors in computer science and history) at Columbia Univeristy in 2017. You can find my full CV [here](/assets/pdfs/keenan_albee_cv.pdf).


### Research Interests

Robotic motion planning; safe motion planning under uncertainty; model predictive control, optimal control, and trajectory optimization; reinforcement learning; information-theoretic planning; space systems.

### Everything Else

I'm an avid backpacker, skier, and gravel biker/bikepacker. I also scuba dive and am a private pilot, and am always working on finding more time for all of the above alongside research. Interestingly enough, many of my hobbies revolve around making real-time planning decisions for dynamical systems in uncertain environments, so they might be considered field work :).
