		<h3>Research</h3>

		<p>We study how robots reason about <b>uncertainty</b> in their environment, including <b>inaccurate models</b>, uncertain <b>state estimates</b>, and the actions of <b>other agents</b>.</p>

		<p>Our work draws on <b>nonlinear control</b>, <b>Bayesian estimation</b>, and modern, learning-based <b>computer vision</b> to enable robots to assess risk online and adapt plans accordingly. Applications include <b>manipulation</b>, <b>locomotion</b>, and <b>space robotics</b>, where robustness is a key barrier to field deployment.</p>
